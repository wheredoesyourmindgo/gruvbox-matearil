# Gruvbox Matearil

> Are you are looking for [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/vscode)? You probably are unless you are not.

This VSCode color scheme is a fork of the super-readable [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/vscode) theme üëç.

## ¬øPor qu√©?

Cause I'm targeting different scopes (using the [_same_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wheredoesyourmindgo/gruvbox-matearil/master/extra/same.gif) palette provided by Gruvbox-Material) for alternate foreground and font style settings, namely for the following language modes:

- TypeScript
- TSX
- JavaScript
- JSX
- HTML
- JSON
- TEX

Notable differences that will likely propagate through all language modes include the use of green strings over yellow strings, and the general swapping of how the purple and red colors are used when compared to Gruvbox-Material. Additionally, italicization will look different too across the board when enabled via User/Workspace Settings.

## Installation, Usage, and Otherwise
