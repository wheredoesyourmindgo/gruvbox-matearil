# Gruvbox Matearil

> Are you are looking for [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/vscode)? You probably are unless you are not.

This VSCode color scheme is a fork of the super-readable [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/vscode) theme üëç.

## ¬øPor qu√©?

Cause I'm using different syntax colors (using the [_same_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wheredoesyourmindgo/gruvbox-matearil/master/extra/same.gif) palette provided by Gruvbox-Material) and font styles, namely for the following language modes:

- Typescript
- TSX
- Javascript
- JSX
- HTML
- TEX

Notable differences that will likely propagate through all language modes includes the use of green strings over yellow strings, and the general swapping of how the purple and red colors are used when compared to Gruvbox-Material.

## Installation, Usage, and Otherwise

See [README.md](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/vscode/blob/master/README.md) on [Gruvbox Material](https://github.com/gruvbox-material/vscode)
